# burger

### This is a fairly straightforward app that allows the user to enter the name of a burger they'd like to eat, which will add it to the "uneaten" list. The user can then "devour" the burger which will move it to the "eaten" list.

###### This app uses a combination of MySQL, Handlebars, Node, Express and good ol' jQuery so that the user's data is stored and the user never needs to leave the page during the experience.
